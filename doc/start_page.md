# Segment Anything for Microscopy

Segment Anything for Microscopy implements automatic and interactive annotation for microscopy data. It is built on top of [Segment Anything](https://segment-anything.com/) by Meta AI and specializes it for microscopy and other bio-imaging data.
Its core components are:
- The `micro_sam` annotator tools: interactive data annotation with [napari](https://napari.org/stable/) applications.
- The `micro_sam` library: apply Segment Anything to multi-dimensional data or fine-tune it on your data.
- The `micro_sam` models: Segment Anything models fine-tuned on publicly available microscopy data.
