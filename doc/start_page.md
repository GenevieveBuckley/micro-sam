# Segment Anything for Microscopy

Segment Anything for Microscopy implements automatic and interactive annotation for microscopy data. It is built on top of [Segment Anything](https://segment-anything.com/) by Meta AI and specializes it for microscopy and other bio-imaging data.
Its core components are:
- The `micro_sam` annotator tools for interactive data annotation with [napari](https://napari.org/stable/).
- The `micro_sam` library to apply Segment Anything to 2 and 3d data or fine-tune it on your data.
- The `micro_sam` models that are fine-tuned on publicly available microscopy data.

Our goal is to build fast and interactive annotation tools for microscopy data, like interactive cell segmentation from bounding boxes:
